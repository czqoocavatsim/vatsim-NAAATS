vNAAATS is a plugin designed to revolutionise day-to-day oceanic operations on the VATSIM network. It simulates the GAATS+ HMI (Gander Automated Air Traffic System +) used by Oceanic controllers at Gander and Prestwick (Shanwick). The plugin supports track drawing, full clearance workflows, and a full conflict toolset for Oceanic controllers. In addition, it supports a CPDLC-esque exchange of data via datalink through natTrak.

### Main Features
- Custom drawn oceanic tags with detailed mode and status indicators
- Smart traffic filtering by area and altitude; oceanic controllers only see the aircraft relevant to them
- NAT Track overlays and overview window
- Smart route drawing function, interpolating NAT tracks as the aircraft's route if they are flying one
- Lists: Inbound (showing direction of flight), Other, Conflicts
- Sep tool showing potential conflicts for two aircraft presuming continuance on current heading
- PIV (Path Intercept Vector) tool showing potential conflicts along two aircraft routes
- RBL (Range Bearing Line) showing distance between two aircraft and indicating any conflicts, distance shown in minutes and miles
- Halo and PTL (Projected Track Line) tools with ability to choose distance
- Custom line ruler mechanic similar to default ES ruler
- Grid display
- Flight plan window with ability to share data between plugins
- Probe tool to detect conflicts down a track before issuing an oceanic clearance
- Controller notepad for general information
- Recognition of aircraft equipment code to determine compatibility with ADS-B procedures and indicator to display whether aircraft is compatible
- Saving of data
- ... and more!

Deleaker has helped me to make vNAAATS amazing by helping me expose the root causes of countless, irritating memory leaks. Without this outstanding piece of software, vNAAATS would be nowhere near as developed as it is right now. Go check out the VS extension here! http://deleaker.com/
